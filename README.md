Code related to my MSc thesis
=============================

This project contains source code related to my Msc thesis entitled `Automatic coherence evaluation applied to topic models'.
To explore it you can follow the following tutorial:  


> make clean

You need an ElasticSearch instance, if not available, download and install elasticsearch executing:
> make install_elasticsearch

Make sure you have the instance up and running.  
> elasticsearch-2.4.0/bin/elasticsearch -d

Install third-party libraries:
> make requirements

Setup test data
> make data

Run LDA to discover topics
> make topics

Compute coherence scores for the discovered topics
> make coherence
